        <p>
            This would be where a lead-in might go. <strong>Be bold.</strong> Be sure to <em>emphasize what you're going on about</em>. It might go on for a while and give an overview of the page, which could be quite lengthy. One never knows what one <strong><em>might</em></strong> want to say when prefacing such a lengthy document.

            Maybe I have something impotant to say. Maybe I don't. Maybe this section is trivial. It's hard to tell before I go into detail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes I need to go on in detail. Sometimes it gets wordy. It takes a lot of time to think of things to say, yet I manage to write them all here. Who knows what drives me? Why am I writing this?

        <blockquote>Someone else said this, <em>not me</em>, and they were quite verbose. Personally, I enjoy brevity because this demands special <strong>formatting</strong>. However, sometimes people take a while to get to their point.</blockquote>
        <p>
            Perhaps there's a minor detail I'm ommiting. Maybe that will explain it. Maybe my audience will finally appreciate my point of view.

                One thing that's important is this. It's a detail that you should know that supports the point above. Many people don't know this detail. That's why I'm sharing it.

            <p>
                There's a lot to discuss here. I'm going to speak to it a bit more. Maybe you should grab a cup of coffee after you read the next paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll be brief, and to the point. There is nothing else to discuss.
